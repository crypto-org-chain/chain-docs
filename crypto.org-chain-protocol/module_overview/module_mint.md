### `mint` module

### Introduction

The `mint` module is responsible for creating token in a flexible way to reward the validator who participate in the proof of stake consensus process (see also the [distribution module](./module_distribution.md)). It is also designed in a way to bring a balance between market liquidity and staked supply.

### Overview

#### Network parameters

Below are all the network parameters for the `mint` module:

- `"blocks_per_year"` - The expected number of blocks being produced per year;
- `"goal_bonded"` - Goal of bonded token in percentage;
- `"inflation_max"` - Maximum annual inflation rate;
- `"inflation_min"` - Minimum annual inflation rate;
- `"inflation_rate_change"` - Maximum annual change in inflation rate;
- `"mint_denom"` - Token type being minted.

The target annual inflation rate is recalculated for each previsions cycle. The inflation is also subject to a rate change (positive or negative) depending on the distance from the desired ratio (`"goal_bonded"`). The maximum rate change possible is defined to be `"inflation_rate_change"` per year, where the annual inflation is capped as between `"inflation_min"` and `"inflation_max"`.

### `mint` module: Queries

### Queries

#### `query mint params` - Query the current minting annual provisions value

We can query the current minting annual provisions value, for example:

```json
  $ chain-maind query mint annual-provisions
  109573801550200370
```

implies that the current minting annual provisions will be `109573801550200370` basecro ( i.e. `1,095,738,015` cro)

#### `query mint inflation` - Query the current minting inflation value

We can query the current minting inflation value, for example:

```json
  $ chain-maind query mint inflation
  0.013687008526984104
```

implies that the current minting annual provisions will be `0.013687008526984104`( i.e. `1.368%`)

#### `query mint annual-provisions` - Query the current minting parameters

We can query the current query parameters by

```json
$ chain-maind query mint params --output json | jq

  {
    "mint_denom": "basetcro",
    "inflation_rate_change": "0.013000000000000000",
    "inflation_max": "0.020000000000000000",
    "inflation_min": "0.007000000000000000",
    "goal_bonded": "0.670000000000000000",
    "blocks_per_year": "6311520"
  }
```
