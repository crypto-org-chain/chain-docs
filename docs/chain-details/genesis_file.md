# Genesis

The `genesis.json` file defines the initial state of the Crypto.org Chain. On top of the standard [tendermint genesis](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#genesis) format, we customize our own genesis file that includes different [modules](#module_overview) and facilitates the special features of the Crypto.org Chain. Sample genesis file can be found [here](https://github.com/crypto-com/testnets/blob/main/testnet-croeseid-2/genesis.json).

## Fields in genesis

Specifically, the genesis file includes the following fields:
