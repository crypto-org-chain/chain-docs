- **Step 2.4** - Afterwards, your wallet is ready to be created. Please make sure you select the following options accordingly:

    - Input your wallet name of your choice;
    - Tick "*Want to create with hardware wallet*" and choose "*Ledger*" as the wallet type. 
    - For the network, three options of "**Testnet**", "**Mainnet**", and "**Custom Devnet**" are given. **Testnet** is Croeseid testnet which is our Cosmos-based testnet that has been running since last October. **Mainnet** is refers to Crypto.org Chain mainnet. Other than these, you may fill up the custom configuration to your own network.
        <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s2-4.png" />
    In this demonstration, we will be creating a testnet address and connecting to the current Croeseid testnet, therefore, we select "**Testnet**" as the network option. 

- **Step 2.5** - Before clicking "*Create Wallet*", make sure you have unlocked and started your Crypto.org Chain App on your Ledger device. Also, you should be able to see "*Crypto.org Chain ready*" displayed on your device as follow: 
        <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s2-5.jpg" />    
    At this step, your wallet should be successfully created:
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s2-5-1.png" />


### Step 3 - Create wallet in Desktop Wallet with Ledger device
In order to start with the sending transaction/performing staking operations, we would need some funds to begin with:

- **Step 3.1** - Go to the "*Receive*" option in the desktop wallet and your wallet address will be displayed. Verify the address by clicking "*Verify address on Ledger*", you should see the same address being displayed on your ledger device as well.

- **Step 3.2** - Once the address has been confirmed, copy this address and request some funds from the [testnet faucet](https://crypto.org/faucet)

- **Step 3.3** - Your current balance will be available on the Home page. If you would like to view the transaction details, simply hit the hash link under Transaction Hash and it will direct you to the [explorer](https://crypto.org/explorer/) where different details related to transactions will be displayed:

    - You can then check the transaction history at the "*Home* page. 

## Staking operation with Ledger device

Crypto.org Chain is based on Tendermint Core's consensus engine, it relies on a set of validators to participate in the proof of stake (PoS) consensus protocol who are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain. Token holders might stake their token to validators to secure the network and earn rewards. Particularly, we can:

- [Delegate to a validator](#delegate-to-a-validator-with-ledger-device);
- [Withdraw staking rewards from a validator](#withdraw-the-reward-from-a-validator-with-ledger-device);
- [Undelegate from a validator](#undelegate-the-staking-from-a-validator-with-ledger-device).


### Delegate to a validator with Ledger device

- To begin staking, please direct to "*Delegate Funds*" under the *Staking* option. You can choose one of the active validators that you would like to delegate to, copy their validator’s "*Operator Address*" (begin with `tcrocncl...` for testnet), put it under "*Validator address*" and specify the amount that you would like to delegate:
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s6.png" />
    Note that you can look up validators and their operator address by the validator list on the [explorer](https://crypto.org/explorer/validators).
- Similar to sending a [transaction](#step-4-send-funds-in-desktop-wallet-with-ledger-device), you can review and confirm the transaction details on the Desktop Wallet first shown as below, click "*Confirm*" and then approve it on your ledger device. 
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s6-2.png" />
- Once the transaction has been approved on you ledger device, you should able to see a success message on your Desktop Wallet:
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s6-3.png" />

### Withdraw the reward from a validator with Ledger device

- Under "*Staking Rewards*" on the Staking page, your staking reward amount from different validators will be displayed as below:
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s7-1.png" />
- Similar to sending a [transaction](#step-4-send-funds-in-desktop-wallet-with-ledger-device), you can review and confirm the transaction details on the Desktop Wallet first, click "*Confirm*" and approve it on your ledger device:
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s7-2.png" />
**Remark**: Please note that all of your available reward from a validator will be withdrawn in the transaction.

- Once the transaction has been approved on you ledger device, you should see a success message on your Desktop Wallet:
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s7-3.png" />

### Undelegate the staking from a validator with Ledger device

Similarly, you can undelegate your staked funds from a validator, and check your current delegation status under the page "*Home-Delegation*", for example: 
            <img src="./assets/ledger_desktop_wallet/s8-1.png" />
- You can undelegate your staked tokens from a validator by clicking "*Undelegate Stake*". Afterwards, you can specify the amount of token that you would like to undelegate from a validator, review and confirm the transaction details on the Desktop Wallet, click "*Confirm*" and approve it on your Ledger device
