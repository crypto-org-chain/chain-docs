# Mainnet Address Generation

This document contains the information of account address for Crypto.org Chain mainnet.

## Address prefix

Account address for mainnet starts with prefix `cro`. For example: `cro1y8ua5laceufhqtwzyhahq0qk7rm87hhugtsfey`.

## Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD Wallet) Derivation Path

Crypto.org Chain has [registered](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) coin type `394` as defined in [BIP44 standard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki).

Coin Type: 394\
Derivation Path: `44'/394'/0'/0/{index}` where index starts from 0.

i.e. the first address is derived at path `44'/394'/0'/0/0` and the second one at path `44'/394'/0'/0/1`.

## How to generate address

::: warning MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR MNEMONIC WORDS\
Before you use the generated mainnet addresses to receive funds on mainnet, make sure that you have backup your address's mnemonic words correctly in a safe place and the mnemonic words are correct such that it can restore to your wallet address in the future.

You are the sole owner of your wallet mnemonic words and there is no way for Crypto.org to restore your wallet or recover your funds if you lost the mnemonic words. :::

::: warning GENERATE ADDRESS ONLY IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT\
We recommend you to generate an address only on a trusted and secure computer. To further enhance the security, you should consider to run on a air-gapped (offline) machine. :::

::: warning ALWAYS VERIFY YOUR MNEMONIC WORDS AND ADDRESS\
To make sure you have backed up the mnemonic words correctly, we recommend you to try to restore your wallet with the mnemonic words and verify the address derived is the same.

For more details on how to verify your mnemonic words and addresses, please check [Mainnet Address Verification](mainnet-address-verification.md) ::: There are four ways to generate the mainnet address by using:

* [Release Binary (CLI)](mainnet-address-generation.md#a-release-binary-cli);
* [Ledger Wallet](mainnet-address-generation.md#b-ledger-wallet);
* [Programmatically via Crypto.org Chain JavaScript Library](mainnet-address-generation.md#c-programmatically); and
* [Crypto.org Chain Desktop Wallet (Beta version)](mainnet-address-generation.md#d-crypto-org-chain-desktop-wallet-beta).

## A. Release Binary (CLI)

Supported OS: Linux, Mac OS and Windows

#### Step 1. Get the Crypto.org Chain binary

Download the Crypto.org Chain Binary for Mainnet from [release page](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases) and extract the binary. Here we used Linux as an example:

```bash
 $ curl -LOJ https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v3.3.9/chain-main_3.3.9_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxvf chain-main_3.3.9_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

If you are downloading the binary for other operating systems, make sure you are downloading `v3.3.9` or newer version that are targeting for mainnet.

Before moving to the next step, kindly check your `chain-maind` version by

```bash
$ ./chain-maind version
3.3.9
```

#### Step 2. Create a new key and address

Run the following command to create a new address. For example, you can create a key with the name "Default" by:

```bash
$ ./chain-maind keys add Default
```

You can find the generated address after running the command. **Please make sure that you have safely backed up the mnemonic words that appear on the last line.**

```bash
- name: Default
  type: local
  address: cro1qxm5lwml3v36h4pygwnn5nfzesupg7cx8nyfkt
  pubkey: cropub1addwnpepqg95fk5grlyucrnvdu8v3h4qnhgcm03ust4yysgtvdjqnh2ytmg6syjkav6
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

## B-i. Ledger Wallet via Release Binary (CLI)

#### Step 1. Get the Crypto.org Chain binary

Download the Crypto.org Chain Binary for Mainnet from [release page](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases) and extract the binary. Here we used Linux as an example:

```bash
$ curl -LOJ https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v3.3.9/chain-main_3.3.9_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf chain-main_3.3.9_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

If you are downloading the binary for other operating systems, make sure you are downloading `v3.3.9`, which is the version targeting for mainnet.

#### Step 2. Open the Crypto.org Chain application on your Ledger device

#### Step 3. Create a new key and address

Run the following command to create a new address. For example, you can create a key with the name "Default" by:

```bash
$ ./chain-maind keys add Ledger --ledger
```

You will be prompted with the address on your Ledger device screen. Read it carefully and write it down. Afterward, confirm the address on your Ledger device.

::: tip Cannot Connect To Your Ledger Device? If you encounter connection error when creating a wallet, you can try to unplug and plug your Ledger device to your computer again. Please make sure your Ledger device is unlocked and you have opened the "Crypto.org Chain" application on your Ledger. :::

#### Step 4. Verify the address displayed on the terminal, and make sure it matches the address you saw on Ledger device

```bash

## C. Programmatically

You can generate the Mnemonic and address programmatically. Here is an example code snippet written in JavaScript using the [Crypto.org Chain JavaScript Library](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain-jslib) to generate the mnemonic and the mainnet address:

```javascript
// Import the library
const sdk = require("@crypto-com/chain-jslib");
const HDKey = sdk.HDKey;
const Secp256k1KeyPair = sdk.Secp256k1KeyPair;

// Initializing the library configurations with TestNet config
const cro = sdk.CroSDK({ network: sdk.CroNetwork.Testnet });

// Generating a random mnemonic words
const randomHDKey = HDKey.generateMnemonic(24); // This returns a 24 words mnemonic phrase

// Display the mnemonics words to the terminal. Only do this in a trusted, safe and offline computer.
// You may consider to store it securely instead of logging it.
console.log(randomHDKey);

// Derive a private key from an HDKey at the specified path
const privateKey = randomHDKey.derivePrivKey("m/44'/1'/0'/0/0");

// Getting a keyPair from a private key
const keyPair = Secp256k1KeyPair.fromPrivKey(privateKey);

// Generate address from the key pair
const address = new cro.Address(keyPair).account();
console.log(address);
```
