## Install the Crypto.org Chain desktop wallet app for Ledger and create the wallet

### Step 1 - Install the Crypto.org Chain app on your Ledger device

* **Step 1.1** - Connect and unlock your Ledger device
* **Step 1.2** - On your Ledger device, go to "_Install app_", It should show "_Open Ledger live to install apps_"
* **Step 1.3** - On the Ledger Live, find Crypto.org Chain & Ethereum to install in the app catalog under "_Manager_" as below: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s1-3-1.png) ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s1-3-2.png)
*   **Step 1.4** - Your Ledger device will display "_Processingâ€¦_". Once the installation is completed, you should see "_Installed_" on your Ledger Live as below: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s1-4-1.png) ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s1-4-2.png)

    You can confirm the installation by checking if the Crypto.org App shows up in the main menu of your Ledger device: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s1-4-3.jpeg)

**Remark**: Once Crypto.org App & Ethereum successfully installed, please remember to close the _Ledger Live_ app before proceeding to the next step .

### Step 2 - Create wallet in Desktop Wallet with Ledger device

After the app is set, please conducting the following steps to create a wallet with the desktop wallet:

* **Step 2.1** - Download the latest Crypto.org Chain desktop wallet [here](https://github.com/crypto-com/chain-desktop-wallet/releases)
* **Step 2.2** - Run the Crypto.org Chain desktop wallet and click "_Get started_": ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/desktop\_wallet/0-2.png)
* **Step 2.3** - Before creating your wallet, you would need to create an App password to protect your desktop wallet: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/desktop\_wallet/0-3.png)
* **Step 2.4** - Afterwards, your wallet is ready to be created. Please make sure you select the following options accordingly:
  * Input your wallet name of your choice;
  * Tick "_Want to create with hardware wallet_" and choose "_Ledger_" as the wallet type.
  * "**Address Index**" is the last value of the Derivation Path (e.g. `44'/394'/0'/0/{address_index}`), which used to derive different addresses from the same key based on different number input. You will need to input the same "**Address Index**" if you want to restore the Ledger wallet address on another device. For the network, three options of "**Testnet Croeseid 4**", "**Mainnet**", and "**Custom Devnet**" are given. **Testnet Croeseid 4** is Croeseid testnet which is our Cosmos-based testnet that has been running since October 2020. **Mainnet** refers to Crypto.org Chain mainnet. Other than these, you can also fill up the custom configuration to your own network. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s2-4.png) In this demonstration, we will be creating a testnet address and connecting to the current Croeseid Testnet, therefore, we select "**Testnet Croeseid 4**" as the network option.
* **Step 2.5** - After click "_Create Wallet_", and you will be asked to open Crypto.org Chain App on your Ledger device. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s2-5-1.png)\
  Before you click "Connect", make sure you are able to see "_Crypto.org Chain ready_" displayed on your device as follow: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s2-5-2.jpg)
* **Step 2.6** - You will be asked to open Ethereum App on your Ledger device in order to create a Cronos Chain wallet. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s2-5-3.png)\
  Make sure you are able to see "_Application is ready_" displayed on your device as follow: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s2-5-4.png)\
  Click "Connect". Both your Crypto.org native chain & Cronos Chain wallet should be successfully created. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s2-5-5.png)

### Step 3 - Before you perform transactions with Ledger device

Before starting with the sending transaction/performing staking operations, we would need some funds to begin with:

* **Step 3.1** - Go to "_Assets_" and pick the asset you would like to transfer. Go to "_Receive_" tab in the desktop wallet and your wallet address will be displayed. Depending on which asset you choose, you might need to open different App on your ledger.

\| App | Supported Assets | | :---: | --- | --- | | Crypto.org | CRO (Crypto.org Chain) | | Ethereum | CRO (Cronos Chain) |

Verify the address by clicking "_Verify address on Ledger_", you should see the same address being displayed on your ledger device as well. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s3-1.png)

* **Step 3.2** - Once the address has been confirmed, copy this address and request some funds from the [testnet faucet](https://crypto.org/faucet)

\| Asset | Faucet | | :---: | --- | --- | | CRO (Crypto.org Chain) | [https://crypto.org/faucet](https://crypto.org/faucet) | | CRO (Cronos Chain) | [https://cronos.crypto.org/faucet](https://cronos.crypto.org/faucet) |

* **Step 3.3** - Your current balance will be available on the "Assets" page. If you would like to view the transaction details, go to the "Transaction" Tab and simply hit the hash link under Transaction Hash, and it will direct you to the corresponding explorer where different details related to transactions will be displayed: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s3-3.png)

**Remark**: In case you have reached the daily limit on faucet airdrop, you can simply send a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pahqHz26q4) #request-tcro channel.

## Confirm transactions in Desktop Wallet with Ledger device

Desktop Wallet supports all sorts of transactions for both normal wallets and wallets created with Ledger device. In this demonstration, we will be confirming a fund sending transaction with a Ledger device.

* **Step 1** - Sending funds is easy with the desktop wallet. Once you obtain some fund from the testnet faucet, go to the "_Assets_" page. Pick your desired assets and click "Send". ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-1-1.png)

Fill up the request information: recipient address, amount to be sent and optional memo as needed: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-1-2.png)

* **Step 2** - Once you hit the "_Continue_" button, you can review the transaction details in the confirmation window on the desktop wallet. Proceed to the next step by clicking "_Confirm_": ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-2-1.png)

**Remark**: If you have not yet established a connection with your Ledger device, a notification will pop up on the top-right hand corner, asking you to confirm the connection with your Ledger. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-2-2.png)

Follow the instructions, and confirm the connection on your ledger device. Make sure you are using the ledger device storing with the same wallet address on Desktop Wallet. ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-3-2.jpeg)

* **Step 3** - Now, your transaction details will be shown on your ledger device, which includes: Chain-id, Account number, sequence, Type of the transaction, the amount in "_basetcro_", Sender address, Receiver address, memo message, Transaction fee and gas: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-3-1.jpeg)
  * You can confirm the details and approve the transaction on the ledger device: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-3-2.jpeg)
  * Once the transaction has been approved on you ledger device, you should see a success message on your Desktop Wallet: ![](../../docs/wallets/assets/ledger\_desktop\_wallet/s4-3-3.png)
  * You can then check the transaction history in "_Transaction_" Tab.

## Restoring a Ledger wallet

Since the private key of Ledger wallets is always stored inside the Ledger device, you don't need the **Mnemonic Phrases** to restore a Ledger wallet on the Desktop Wallet. You may also follow the [_Create wallet in Desktop Wallet with Ledger device Guide_](ledger\_desktop\_wallet.md#step-2-create-wallet-in-desktop-wallet-with-ledger-device) to restore your previously created Ledger wallet.

Please note that you may still need to input the correct **Address Index** to derive your desired Ledger wallet address.

## Ledger connection troubleshoot

Most ledger users are able to connect to Crypto.org Chain Desktop Wallet (Beta) efficiently, while some users may encounter connection issues. Below are the most common reasons that cause the connection problem between a Ledger device and the Crypto.org Chain Desktop Wallet (Beta) and a checklist that you may refer to troubleshoot the issue:

* Use the latest version of "Crypto.org App" & "Ethereum App" on Ledger
* Wait several seconds after the App on Ledger device is first opened
* If you have connected the Ledger device on other applications, e.g. Ledger Live, close these applications since they could potentially occupy the Ledger connection channel
* Restart your machine to clear off any potential connection channel occupancy
* Check if your USB cable is working properly
* Check if your USB port on your machine is working properly
