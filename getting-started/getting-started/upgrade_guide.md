:::warning
The chain-maind `v2.0.1` - Canis Major upgrade is completed at block height `922,363`

:::

For those who want to enjoy the automatic upgrade managed by [cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/cosmovisor.html), please follow this [cosmovisor guide](./cosmovisor.md) for the coming "Canis Major" network upgrade. Otherwise, please continue below manual upgrade steps.

## Step 0 - Don't panic 
Once you have started syncing the blockchain from block `1` by using `v1.*` binary, at the point of reaching block height `922,363`, user will see the following error message on the `chain-maind`: 

`ERR UPGRADE "v2.0.0" NEEDED at time: 2021-06-01T23:59:00Z: {"binaries":{"darwin/amd64":"https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz?checksum=sha256:a4d51bf98350c7ecbb5e6bab192c9cac2f4059754e5507d2a1970a8a5488c74a","darwin/arm64":"https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz?checksum=sha256:eb6274724eab1957a7b708a5a0887de9f213d053841fb58041f697e13728a454","linux/amd64":"https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz?checksum=sha256:5e9e9f703cb85c72573086e384e187e752463b2ed0ccd612094a1f29a13f0158","linux/arm64":"https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Linux_arm64.tar.gz?checksum=sha256:345c7eacfc768df355c3b3ecadc9cc39e3c1656c9c0c4d465b938834fa66ff03","windows/amd64":"https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Windows_x86_64.zip?checksum=sha256:07b06382397df49774788ec06a5c9d0bf7e28ddb7b1dd91abdb35174bce49a31"}}`

Validators and full node hosts will have to upgrade your Crypto.org Chain nodes to the `v2.0.1` binary.

## Step 1 - Get the `v2.0.1` binary

To simplify the following step, we will be using **Linux** for illustration. Binary for
[Mac](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz) and [Windows](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Windows_x86_64.zip) are also available. 

- Terminate the `chain-maind`; afterwards, download the `v2.0.1` released binaries from github:

  ```bash
  $ curl -LOJ https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/releases/download/v2.0.1/chain-main_2.0.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
  $ tar -zxvf chain-main_2.0.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
  ```


    ::: tip Remarks: 
    If you have stated `chain-maind` with *systemd* service, kindly stop it by 

    ```bash 
    $ sudo systemctl stop chain-maind
    ```
    And replace the binary in the location where the `ExecStart` states in Systemd Unit file.
    
    :::



- For [homebrew](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/homebrew-chain-maind#chain-maind-homebrew-tap) users, simply run 

    ```bash 
    $ brew upgrade chain-maind
    ```
### Step 1.1 -  Verify the version

You can verify the installation by checking the version of `chain-maind`, the latest version is `2.0.1`.

  ```bash 
  # check the version of chain-maind
  $ ./chain-maind version
  2.0.1
  ```

## Step 2. - Run everything

We are ready to start the node join the network again with the new binary:

- Start `chain-maind`, e.g.:

```bash
  $ ./chain-maind start
```

Sit back and wait for the syncing process. You can query the node syncing status by
  ```bash
  $ ./chain-maind status 2>&1 | jq '.SyncInfo.catching_up'
  ```
If the above command returns `false`, it means that your node **is synced**; otherwise, it returns `true` and implies your node is still catching up.


## Getting ready - "DRACO II" second netwrok upgrade 

At last step, you've successfully performed the **"Canis Major"** binary upgrade! Allow sometime for the node to catch up, meanwhile, you can get ready for  **"DRACO II"** ,the second network upgrade  ( from `v2.*` to `v3.1.1` at block height `2,472,800` ) by following this [guide](./upgrade_guide_draco_2.md).
